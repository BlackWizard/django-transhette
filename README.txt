Transhette
==========

A simple Django application that  eases the translation process 
of your Django projects. 

Some of its features are:

* Database independent
* Reads and writes your project's gettext catalogs (po and mo files)
* Installed and uninstalled in under a minute
* Uses Django's admin interface CSS
* Translation suggestions via Google AJAX Language API 

Transhette was originally based on `rosetta
<http://code.google.com/p/django-rosetta/>`_ , which uses
`polib <http://code.google.com/p/polib/>`_. Both projects are distributed
under the MIT License. 

Transhette is distributed under the terms of the `GNU Lesser General Public
License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>`_.
